There isn’t much to stop and look at out in the forest, other that trees and plants growing. So it’s a nice way to get into the zone and do a little soul-searching.

When I was planning this trip, I wasn’t sure if I would find good places to camp. That was not a problem, there were plenty of nice, quiet lakes, and some of them had a gapahuk next to them. So if you don’t want long days, or would like to take it slow, there are plenty of places to rest.

*[Våler, Norge](https://www.google.com/maps/place/60.848422399722224,12.305143199722224): There was a lot of rivers to cross, and I think you could paddle most of them.*

At the end of the last day was a small hamlet, with a store, but since it was a ban holiday in Norway (Feast of the Ascension) I was sure it was closed. Luckily I decided to pass by it, and it turned out to be a self-service store! That was such a relief! Mostly because I was tired (after one breakfast) of eating soup. So I got some bread, bread spread, and a dessert! I was pretty tired, and bought way more than I had room for. It was a good thing the cabin I was staying in was just 30m away.

*[Åsnes, Norge](https://www.google.com/maps/place/60.659948799999995,12.235301599722222): There are so many big farms in this part of Norway.*

Arriving at the cabin there were two motorcyclists unpacking their stuf. They were traveling the other direction, and were also ready for a night inside. The cabin was part of the DNT network of unsupported cabins, meaning that you need to have a key, pay a fee (for the night), and then you have access to a bunch of shelters everywhere in Norway. This specific cabin was an old log-driver cabin, so it was just one room, three bunk beds, and what you need to make some food and eat it. And of course a big fireplace to keep warm when it’s cold.

A little bit later six(!) other motorcyclists showed up, hoping that the cabin would be empty. Since three of the beds were already occupied, and their tents didn’t really fit the place outside, they decided to find another place to stay for the night.

It was nice chatting with the motorcyclists.

*[Åsnes, Norge](https://www.google.com/maps/place/60.5517824,12.330427999722222): You’ll get used to looking at trees.*

*[Grue, Norge](https://www.google.com/maps/place/60.38014079972222,12.423799199722222): It was good to sleep inside when it rained the whole night.*
