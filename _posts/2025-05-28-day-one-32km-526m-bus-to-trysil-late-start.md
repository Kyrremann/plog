As there where some delays out of Oslo, I was a bit behind schedule when I arrived at Trysil Turistsenter. Still, the weather was nice, and the sun wouldn’t set for another three hours. Plenty of time for me to cycle the 30 km to the planned lean-to (gapahuk in Norwegian).

![Using forced perspective, I made a statute of a log driver huge, towering over the woods.](https://kyrremann-plog.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud/images/2025/05/20250528_203503.jpg)
*[Trysil, Norge](https://www.google.com/maps/place/61.2472512,12.015076):  There has been a lot of log driving throughout the whole route I’m cycling.*

Instead of starting down in Trysil city center I stayed on the bus until the next stop, which saved me some altitudes. After passing all the cabins built around the ski resort, it was just straight gravel roads, and wood all around.

I managed to reach my shelter for the night not long before it started raining, and the lean-to was big enough for me to set up my tent inside of it. The night was colder than I had hoped for, especially since I didn’t put up the rain fly, so the air around me got constantly moved around.
