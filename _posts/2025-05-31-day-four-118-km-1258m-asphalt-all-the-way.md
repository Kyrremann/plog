*[Halden, Norge](https://www.google.com/maps/place/59.1203584,11.384202399722222): I totally forgot that there is a huge fortress overlooking the city.*

Last day started with bright sunshine, and an easy breakfast next to my tent. I had stayed over at a campsite, so I even got to take a shower before I went to bed last night.

Most of the trip today I would be following the national road number 21, so tarmac all the way to Halden! I was worried there would be a lot traffic, but it turned out to be a pretty pleasant ride, as there was surprisingly few cars on the road. And most of them where heading towards me.

The half-way point was Ã˜rje, that has a big three storied locks channel! There is even a museum there, but I forgot to visit that one this time too. This time I prioritized a sandwich and a beer at a local cafe, sitting outside soaking up the sun!

After lunch, Halden was next! The rest of the trip was pretty uneventful, other than my problem with air leaking from my rear tire. Since I was running tubeless, I was hesitant to give up and switch to a tube, so I ended up stopping every 30 minute or so, to refill my tire. Not sure if I saved any time there.

*[Knardal, Halden, Norge](https://www.google.com/maps/place/59.1189363,11.3961669): Can recommend using some time to explore the fortress.*

I was kinda racing the clock to catch a train earlier than planned, but I manage to arrive at the station just as the train left. Luckily that gave me an hour to do some sightseeing in Halden, and eat a big ice cream. I have never been to Halden before, so when I turned away from the station I was reminded that there is a huge fortress overlooking the city of Halden! So after an ice cream stop, I hike-a-biked the steep hills all the way to the top! Had I planned a little bit better I would have skipped trying to catch the earlier train, and just biked up to the fortress as I entered the city.

After that, it was a relaxing two hour train trip back home.
