Plog
====

A simple picture log, made for friends and family.
This is used instead of Instagram.
I've made a newsletter if you want a notification for each post, or you can follow the RSS feed.


Icons from icons8.com.

Development
===========

Site hosted by Github pages, and images hosted by Scaleway storage using the `Bucket website` feature.
